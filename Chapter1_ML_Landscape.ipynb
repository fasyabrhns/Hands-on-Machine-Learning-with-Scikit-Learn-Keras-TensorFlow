    "### What Is Machine Learning?\n",
    "Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.* —Arthur Samuel, 1959\n",
    "- *A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.* —Tom Mitchell, 1997\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A spam filter is a Machine Learning program that learns from examples of spam and ham emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task (T): flag spam for new emails\n",
    "- Experience (E): the training data\n",
    "- Performance (P): ratio of correctly classified emails (accuracy)\n"
