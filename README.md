## 🌟 Introduction  

This repository contains my personal journey of reproducing code, notes, and theoretical insights from:  

**Aurélien Géron – Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow (2nd Edition, O’Reilly).**  

The purpose of this project is to:  
- Practice and reinforce key Machine Learning & Deep Learning concepts.  
- Build a structured collection of Jupyter Notebooks for every chapter.  
- Summarize theories in a concise yet comprehensive manner.

## 📑 Part I – The Fundamentals of Machine Learning  

Machine Learning enables systems to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of designing rules, we let algorithms extract patterns from examples.  

### Chapters:  
- **The Machine Learning Landscape** – Overview of ML, applications, types, and challenges.  
- **End-to-End ML Project** – Full workflow: data gathering, preprocessing, model training, and deployment.  
- **Classification** – Techniques for classification problems, evaluation metrics.  
- **Training Models** – Linear models, gradient descent, regularization.  
- **Support Vector Machines** – Linear & nonlinear SVMs, kernel trick.  
- **Decision Trees** – Splitting criteria, interpretability, ensembles.  
- **Ensemble Learning & Random Forests** – Bagging, boosting, and model averaging.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction** – PCA, kernel PCA, manifold learning.

## 🎯 What You Will Gain  

- A strong grasp of ML and DL fundamentals.  
- Hands-on coding experience with Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.  
- Understanding of practical issues like overfitting, underfitting, and data preparation.  
- End-to-end skills: from theory → implementation → deployment.
